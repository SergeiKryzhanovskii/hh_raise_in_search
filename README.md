### Program feature
#### Headless for Chrome
In the repository, this option is commented out.
This means that the browser starts with a graphical interface.
To work in the background you need to uncomment this line:
```python
options.add_argument('headless')
```
#### Headless for Firefox
In the repository, this option is commented out.
This means that the browser starts with a graphical interface.
To work in the background you need to uncomment this line:

### Command line & PyCharm
When you run the program in command line - it's Ok.
When you run the programm in PyCharm - she may stop at the password entry step. 
This is a feature of the library`getpass`.
To run in PyCharm you need to uncomment the line:
```python
my_password = input('Please, enter password: ').split()
```
and comment out the line:

```python
my_password = getpass.getpass('Please, enter password: ').split()
```

------------

### Warning
- A different version `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` of drivers may be required to emulate the browser (I attach links at the beginning).
- The version depends on the operating system and build of your browser.
- The repository comes with drivers for Windows 10.
- It is important to indicate the correct path in the program to the driver files.

### Just for fun 
The program commented out the lines of the music file playback. If you uncomment them, the program will notify the user about the start of work and the occurrence of errors.
She will notify with the help of audio fragments from the Soviet comedy film "Diamond Hand". #justforfun
